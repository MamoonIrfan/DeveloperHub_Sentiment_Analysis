# Task 2: Sentiment Analysis

A simple **Sentiment Analysis project** built with Python.  
This project classifies IMDB movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** using text preprocessing, feature extraction, and a Logistic Regression model.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Sentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task where the goal is to identify whether a given text expresses a **positive** or **negative** sentiment.  
In this project, we used a dataset of 1000 IMDB reviews and applied basic Machine Learning techniques to classify reviews.
